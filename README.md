Give this prompt to Firebase Studio or integrate it manually for full auth setup.

Prompt:

txt
Copy
Edit
You are building the complete authentication and authorization system for a logistics and delivery platform named "AirNow", using Firebase.

Please implement and configure the following:

---

AUTHENTICATION:
1. Enable the following authentication providers:
   - Email & Password
   - Phone Number (SMS OTP)
   - Google OAuth
   - Apple OAuth (if available)
   
2. Implement multi-step registration flows:
   - Customer Registration: name, email, phone, password
   - Agent Registration: name, phone, email, password, upload documents (driver's license, ID)
   - Admin: manually added in Firebase console
   - Dispatcher & Partner Vendors: invite-only or manual add by Admin

3. Set up multi-device login support with secure session handling:
   - Use refresh tokens
   - Track active sessions per user

4. Configure secure password reset flows:
   - Email-based recovery
   - Phone-based OTP recovery

5. Implement 2FA for Admin logins

---

AUTHORIZATION:
6. Use Firebase Firestore to manage Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Create a `users` collection
   - Each document should contain:
     - uid
     - email
     - phone
     - role (customer, agent, admin, dispatcher, vendor)
     - isVerified (boolean)
     - profileComplete (boolean)
     - createdAt, updatedAt timestamps

7. Implement custom claims via Firebase Functions:
   - On user registration or admin approval, assign a role to the user
   - Enforce role-based access via claims (e.g., admin-only routes)

8. For delivery agents:
   - Store their approval status: pending, approved, rejected
   - Deny access to core features until approved

---

SECURITY:
9. Configure Firestore Security Rules:
   - Only users with `role == admin` can access admin collections
   - Agents can only access orders assigned to them
   - Customers can only access their own orders
   - Vendors can only access their own deliveries

10. Configure Firebase Storage Rules:
   - Restrict access to ID uploads only to owner and admin

---

FUTURE INTEGRATIONS:
11. Expose auth endpoints securely for frontend and mobile apps
12. Provide APIs via Firebase Functions for:
   - Custom login
   - Token validation
   - Role-based dashboard content

Return the complete setup guide, list of rules, and code snippets for Firebase Functions, Security Rules, and Role Management.



 FIREBASE AI STUDIO PROMPT
‚ÄúAct as a senior full-stack Firebase architect. I am building a highly secure and scalable web platform using Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Functions, Hosting). I need you to deeply analyze and help me set up and audit the following:‚Äù

üîí AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION:
Enforce email/password + social login (Google, Apple).

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with roles: admin, editor, user, guest.

Store roles in Firestore and secure them via Firebase Rules.

Prevent privilege escalation and unauthorized access across all pages and API endpoints.

Provide multi-device session handling and token revocation logic.

Ensure support for protected routes (e.g., /dashboard, /admin) and fallback for unauthenticated users.

üß± FULL STACK INTEGRATION:
Connect frontend UI (React or Next.js) to backend Firebase Functions.

Bind Firestore reads/writes with real-time sync for each user role.

Secure each Firestore collection and document with role-aware security rules.

Integrate Firestore with authenticated user data and activity logs.

Show me where and how I should use Firebase Callable Functions vs REST endpoints.

‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR HANDLING & FALLBACKS:
Provide a global error boundary on the frontend with clear user-friendly error messages.

Set up Firebase Functions with try/catch and structured logging (via functions.logger).

Handle edge cases like:

No internet

Auth token expiry

Firestore read/write failure

Unauthorized access attempts

Backend timeouts

Include fallback UIs for network errors and loading states.

üîê SECURITY & DATA VALIDATION:
Enable App Check and configure it for both web and mobile clients.

Use Firestore Rules to validate every field on writes.

Ensure security around Firestore documents using request.auth and custom claims.

Ensure tokens can‚Äôt be manipulated or hijacked.

Add rate-limiting or abuse protection on sensitive endpoints.

üß™ QA & DEPLOYMENT READINESS:
Help me test every route, auth flow, Firestore rule, and function.

Show me how to simulate bad actors and broken logic.

Guide me through how to run security audits using Firebase tools.

Validate that Firestore indexes, rules, and functions are optimized for production.

Assist in a final deployment checklist to confirm full readiness.

üö® EXTRAS:
Error logging: Integrate Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics for web.

Analytics: Track user behavior for each authenticated role.

Notifications: Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for backend-to-user push updates.

üîÅ BONUS: Ask AI Studio for Output Like This:
You can end the prompt with:

‚ÄúGive me:

A full implementation plan (step-by-step)

The Firebase Rules config

All relevant Firebase Function code templates

Prompt:

You are working on a full-stack web application. I have a user dashboard in my project, but most features inside the dashboard are currently not working. I need you to fix this and ensure full functionality, great UI/UX, and responsiveness.

Here is what I need you to do:

Fix Feature Navigation & Build Pages:

Currently, clicking on dashboard feature buttons does not redirect to the correct pages.

For each feature, build the necessary page if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet.

Make sure clicking a feature button navigates to the correct page and the page is fully functional.

Improve Dashboard Navigation Menu:

Remove "Login" and "Signup" buttons from the dashboard‚Äôs notification/menu area for logged-in users.

Replace the current generic notification menu with a proper dashboard navigation menu that shows all available dashboard features as clickable items.

This menu should allow users to easily navigate to all dashboard features without going back to the homepage.

Fix & Integrate AI Chat Feature in Dashboard:

I already have the API for the AI chat feature; connect it so that the chat is fully functional.

Make sure the chat is responsive: users can send text or voice, and the AI responds in real time.

Ensure it works seamlessly across desktop and mobile.

Improve UI/UX:

Make the dashboard visually appealing, modern, and classic.

Maintain responsive design for all devices.

Use consistent styling, clean layout, and clear navigation.

Functionality Checks:

Ensure every button, link, and feature works correctly.

Test the dashboard end-to-end so there are no broken links, unresponsive buttons, or UI glitches.

Goal:
Deliver a fully functional, responsive, and visually impressive dashboard where every feature works correctly, the navigation is intuitive, the AI chat is integrated and responsive, and the overall user experience is smooth and engaging.




Prompt to Give Your Developer/AI
Here‚Äôs a consolidated instruction you can drop into your AI/dev environment:

Prompt:
Enhance the dashboard by making every feature fully functional and accessible. Each feature button should redirect to its dedicated page, and any missing feature page should be created and integrated. Update the dashboard navigation menu so it dynamically lists the features available in the user‚Äôs dashboard, replacing the current login/signup buttons with relevant options. Improve the notification system to include real-time categorized alerts (orders, AI updates, messages, recommendations), and ensure notifications link to their respective feature pages.

Connect the AI assistant to the API provided so it works responsively in both text and voice mode, providing context-aware answers and shortcuts like ‚ÄúBook service‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrack order.‚Äù Add 3D animated feature listings for services, using modern futuristic UI styles such as glassmorphism or neumorphism, smooth animations, and custom icons.

Additional essential features to implement:

Editable profile settings (photo, username, theme).

Global search bar with instant results for all dashboard content.

Real-time order/service tracking with a timeline view.

Quick action floating button for new bookings.

Gamification elements like badges & usage points.

Enhanced security with optional 2FA and login activity logs.

Apply a modern, engaging design with smooth transitions, micro-interactions, and responsive layouts for all devices. The dashboard should feel futuristic, interactive, and highly intuitive.
